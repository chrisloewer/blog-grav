# Notes for Grav Blog

This is a document to keep track of some of the configurations/settings that should be recorded.

## Plugins
In order to keep the repo lightweight and avoid flooding it with unimportant updates, I will no longer be tracking plugins. The plugins folder will be ignored in the .gitignore file.

Some of these will be optional to install, while others may be required. These are the plugins currently recommended for this installation.

#### Current Plugins:
- admin
- devtools
- email
- error
- form
- login
- markdown-notices
- problems

By not tracking the plugins, the commit history will not be littered with updates of plugins. In addition, there are plugins (such as admin) that make live easier, but are not required to run the blog.
