Allow me to introduce myself. I am a student of web development, amatuer coffee aficionado, longboarder, and hopeless film addict. I am currently working as a front end developer and am about to hit 6 years in East Texas.

===

I was born in the USA, but was raised in Kenya, first in Mombasa and then later in Nairobi. After graduation I moved to Longview, TX. I've worked all over the US, studied abroad in South Korea, and even circumnavigated the globe. My bucket list includes backpacking through Europe, rafting the Nile, and running with the bulls in Pamplona in true Hemingway fashion.

Enough people have asked me how I did X project or wrote Y code that I decided to create this blog as a platform to share some of what I've been up to. I mean for this blog to catalog my technical adventures into the unknown. Hopefully it's helpful, and maybe even a little bit interesting.

Disclaimer:  This blog has a tendency to be a guinea pig for whatever platform or framework I happen to be working with at the moment.  Because of this it evolves fairly often.  There is typically a blog post for each time I make a major change with more details.
